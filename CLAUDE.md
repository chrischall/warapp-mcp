# CLAUDE.md — warapp-mcp

Read-only advisor MCP for war.app (Warzone), direct-API archetype: every request is
`POST https://war.app/API/GameFeed?GameID=<n>` with a form body `Email=…&APIToken=…`.
The build plan is `docs/PLAN.md`.

## What is true only of this repo

- **Errors are HTTP 200.** GameFeed answers failures as 200 JSON `{ termsOfUse, error }`
  (`Auth failed`, `…ServerGameKeyNotFound`, `GameID must be an integer`). Never decide
  success from the status alone.
- **The healthcheck probes a game that does not exist** (`GameID=2147483647`): war.app
  checks credentials first, so `ServerGameKeyNotFound` proves the token works without
  loading a real game, and `Auth failed` is a rejected credential.
- **Credentials:** `WARAPP_EMAIL` + `WARAPP_API_TOKEN`, deferred (the server boots
  without them). `src/index.ts` loads `WARAPP_ENV_FILE` / `~/.config/warapp-mcp/.env`
  with `loadDotenvSafely` (host env wins). The token and email are scrubbed by value
  from every upstream error string. Never print or commit the real env file.
- **Hosted per user.** `mint.yaml` uses `identity.perUserChild` + `auth.fields`, because
  GameFeed answers as the player whose token is presented (fog of war included). Its
  only egress is `war.app`.
- **Read-only.** Order submission is out of scope until a live capture of a turn exists.
- **Every GameFeed scalar is a string** (ids, counts, booleans); normalize before use —
  see `docs/PLAN.md` "Facts". Fixtures under `tests/fixtures/` are anonymized.
- **API facts live in `docs/WARAPP-API.md`**, each marked verified or unverified. The board
  standing parser (`src/board.ts`) is unverified and must stay loose (never throw). Territory
  and bonus ids overlap, so a bonus member is a territory first and a superbonus only otherwise.
- **All GameFeed traffic goes through `WarappClient` (`src/client.ts`)**, including the
  healthcheck probe. Maps are cached per process (`MapCache`), and a known game is re-fetched
  with `GetMap=false`.
